# MultiThreaded_CPP
Multi-threaded example in C++
***

This script is meant to showcase the ability and speed of multi-threading calculations in C++. In this example on a 24 thread CPU, the single thread takes about 6 seconds to complete finding the squares of all values from 1 to 200 million. While utilizing all of the 24 threads takes only about 0.5 seconds.
